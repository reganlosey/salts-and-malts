## Overview
- Salts and Malts was designed to allow users to view detailed information about beer, including abv, ibu, a brief description, and a short list of food pairings. 
The homepage provides a view of all available beers as well as buttons that allow the user to sort the beers by the type listed on each button. Users have the ability to click on the "More about this brew" button to be redirected to a page that expands on that specific beer's information.
This project uses React.js, React Router, Cypress, and SASS to actively manipulate data from [BrewDog's Punk API](https://punkapi.com/) into an intuitive user experience.

## Languages/Technology
- React 
- React Router
- Javascript
- HTML
- SASS/SCSS
- Cypress

## Learning Goals
- Display competency and gain experience with React.js
- Create a multi-page UX using Router
- Test React components & asynchronous Javascript using End-to-End testing


## Install & Setup
* Visit deployed site [here](https://reganlosey.github.io/salts-and-malts/)
Or:
1. Clone this down
2. `cd` into the directory
3. Run `npm install` and then `npm start`
5. Head to `localhost:3000` in your browser  

## How to Use:
- Scroll through the homepage to see all available beers and a quick view of their ABV and IBU. To filter by a specific style of beer, click the corresponding button on the top.
Click on the beer's "More about this brew" button to be redirected to an expanded view with more information.

## Future Directions
1. Add a search bar to the homepage to search by beer name.
2. Implement filtering by other queries.
3. Add food icons as they relate to the pairings.
   
## Wins:
- The biggest win I had during this project was manipulating the data from the API I was working with. Each object is huge with a ton of different properties so getting everything to condense down so that I could use it was a victory for sure.
- Using Router on my own. In my past group projects, troubleshooting the exact location of the data across components was easier with more brains working together. Doing it by myself proved to be more difficult but was satisfying once everything was wrapped up.
- Getting the data to filter accurately with the beer type buttons.

## Challenges:
- Starting a big React solo project from scratch was a little more intimidating than doing it with other developers.
- I reached a little too high when first planning out my user stories. I've made note to thoroughly test the API I'm working with to see what it takes to get a specific piece of information, and which endpoints I need to hit.
