## Overview
- Salts and Malts was designed to allow users to view detailed information about beer, including abv, ibu, a brief description, and a short list of food pairings. 
The homepage provides a view of all available beers as well as buttons that allow the user to sort the beers by the type listed on each button. Users have the ability to click on the "More about this brew" button to be redirected to a page that expands on that specific beer's information.
This project uses React.js, React Router, Cypress, and SASS to actively manipulate data from [BrewDog's Punk API](https://punkapi.com/) into an intuitive user experience.

## Languages/Technology
- React 
- React Router
- Javascript
- HTML
- SASS/SCSS
- Cypress

## Learning Goals
- Display competency and gain experience with React.js
- Create a multi-page UX using Router
- Test React components & asynchronous Javascript using End-to-End testing
